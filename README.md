# Flutter Beacon

GSoC'20 take-home qualification task for CCExtractor.org

Task: Write a Flutter app that is able to share your location with anyone who has a specific passkey. Your app then will have two modes of operation: Someone is sharing their location (that means “carrying the beacon”) and everybody else can see that location (they are “following the beacon”).
